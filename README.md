# Rock, Paper, Scissors

My own Rock, Paper, Scissors game from scratch!

**Link to project:** Link coming soon

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

I used this as my first project to really tie together my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills together for the first time. As someone who is switching industries and self-taught, there was a steep learning curve. I had to seriously debug things for the first time and it was incredibly satisfying to solve problems in my own code.

## Optimizations

Because this was my first real project, I'm sure there is some hacky code. I tried my best to have meaningful commit messages and descriptive, maintainable, readable code. The logic I used and how I named the variables was sort of the first path I went down. At one point when I was stuck, I thought I might start from scratch but was able to work out what was happening.

## Lessons Learned:

No matter what your experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. This project had a few of those "aha" moments and I was able to push through some walls and gain a lot of confidence in my abilities moving forward.
